# water quality prediction project(AICTE Internship Projects – June 2025 (Trainer Resources))
This repository hosts the complete set of project materials, datasets, and code developed for the AICTE Virtual Internship Program – Cycle 1, conducted in collaboration with Shell and Edunet Foundation – Skills4Future.

# Internship Summary
Program: AICTE Virtual Internship – June 2025 Cohort


Dates: June 16 – July 16, 2025


Trainer: Raghunandan M S (Skills4Future)


Theme: Environmental Data Analytics & Machine Learning (Green Skills Development)


# Project Topics:


Carbon Emissions Forecasting


Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis


Water Quality Assessment and Prediction



# Repository Layout
Each project folder includes weekly deliverables, datasets, scripts, and model files to support end-to-end project work.

1. Carbon Emissions Forecasting
Objective: Build models to estimate carbon emissions using country-level historical data.


Included Materials:


Weekly progress folders (Weeks 1–3)


Data preparation and cleaning scripts


Jupyter notebooks for model development and results visualization



2. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis
Objective: Analyze and predict GHG emission patterns leveraging machine learning techniques.


# Contents:


Weekly submissions and reports


Data exploration notebooks


Model training pipelines and evaluation summaries



3. Water Quality prediction
Objective: Apply MultiOutput Regression models to predict water quality parameters and potability.


Included Files:


Structured weekly work submissions


Water quality datasets and preprocessing scripts


Deployment-ready model artifacts

# Trainer Notes
Each project folder documents the interns’ weekly progress and culminates in the final deliverables. This internship placed a strong emphasis on practical, applied learning in:
Data preprocessing and cleaning workflows


Building predictive models (regression techniques)


Analyzing and interpreting model outcomes


Communicating results effectively in a virtual setup



# Datasets
All relevant datasets are packaged within the corresponding project directories for easy access and reproducibility.
